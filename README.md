# Campus QuickStart

Campus QuickStart (CQS) is a web application built at PennApps X, a hackathon hosted at the University of Pennsylvania. CQS aims to establish a new organization's online presence, so that its staff can focus on building the rest. It was created with Python 3 and uses Bottle and MongoDB.

## Inspiration for CQS

I am involved in various clubs and organizations on campus, so I often run into new faces interested in creating their own clubs or organizations. They have bright ideas, but lack enthusiasm and drive in seeing it through. Commitments to clubs and organizations take up plenty of time, regardless of whether the person in question is a member or is on the board. There's paperwork to fillout with the university to establish such groups, as well as setting budgets, recruiting board members, and promoting the group to the student body. Very often, the brand of the organization is overlooked for acquiring as possibly large as a foundation of members as possible, only to end up with very little staff and structure to keep the newly established community going. With so many other worries to occupy someone's mind outside of creating the organization, these ideas are often abandoned and forgotten. Campus QuickStart (CQS) aims to ease the process of starting up an organization at a university or high school by automating the process of establishing an online brand and presence.

## What can CQS do?

With CQS, everyone regardless of experience in web development can get a website started for their organization and attach other third party services (e.g. Facebook, Twitter). CQS is everyone's one-stop portal to create and manage their groups. Many organizations lose track of their social media and become inactive. They may pay for a domain through one provider, hosting through another, create Facebook pages, Twitter accounts, and LinkedIn groups. Students possessing technical experience may graduate, leaving others taking their place overwhelmed and confused at the number of services they have to work with. CQS, in the long term, aims to simplify the overall brand by providing access to all these services in an easily navigable dashboard. Email communications and social media are the top ways of reaching out to members - email can be checked on your phones or on your computer. Many spend their time on Facebook long enough to see the important announcements across social platforms. However, as organizations grow in size, so do their tools, making organization and structure as important as ever. CQS isn't just for getting ideas out there, but for keeping them alive by facilitating the process of establishing an online presence.

## How CQS works

CQS starts off by asking for some details about your organization to create your account. MongoDB keeps track of users and the groups they're involved in and SendGrid ensures email communications between the board and members. CQS provides some starting templates for the website and plugs in the information it receives from you. Templates of all kinds can be potentially modified to fit the information that you provide about your organization. Each group managed with CQS can have its own website hosted by CQS. If you have any technical experience, you're free to export the files for self-hosting on your own server or in the future, via GitHub pages. Another future implementation would be using the NameCheap API to allow for domain purchases and management via CQS for your CQS-hosted websites. The original URL off CQS will always be available in additional to a secondary domain purchased off a third party.

## Future Plans

- Redo design
  - Move to material design
  - Simplify starting experience
- Add GitHub option
- Add download option (i.e. .zip, .tar.gz, .rar)
